# Find and Remove Forbidden Words

This program takes as input a whole number base [2,10], an allowed word in that base, and calculates forbidden subwords and words in that base.

For larger bases, it is recommended to use the option to export to a file. Please note that it will be placed in the directory above where the source code is compiled and run.

# Compiling from source
Put all of the files in a directory title "findAndRemoveForbiddenWords".
Then:

  javac findAndRemoveForbiddenWords/*.java

  java -cp . findAndRemoveForbiddenWords.Main

which will compile and then run the program. You may have to change the file separator depending on your operating system. The above should work for Unix/Linux systems.
